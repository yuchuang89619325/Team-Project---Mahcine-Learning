README

There are two files uploaded as submission to the Final Project.

The first one is train.ipynb. It is a function which expects X and Y in the second cell. The last cell is where the function is called.Â 

The second file is test.py. It is a function which expects X in the second cell. It expects X to be a matrix of MxN where M is the number of pixels and N is the number of samples. The last cell is where the function is called. It returns a vector y which is the class label associated with each input.


Necessary Libraries: The libraries imported for the implementation includes tensorflow, keras, cv2, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib. The packages included in keras are utils, layers and models.
